			<h2 class="hdr-txt">Biography</h2>
			<p>Steve Jobs (1955â€“2011) was an American entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc., shaping modern technology. In 1976, he established Apple with Steve Wozniak, introducing the Apple I and later the Apple II, revolutionizing
				personal computing. After leaving Apple in 1985, he founded NeNext Computer and acquired Pixar Animation Studios. His 1997 return revitalized Apple, leading to iconic products like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad that blended technology
				and design. Jobs' perfectionism and innovative spirit drove Apple's success, though his intense leadership style caused challenges. Diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, he continued working while confronting mortality.
				His legacy endures beyond technology. His 2005 Stanford commencement speech emphasized following one's heart and embracing challenges. On October 5, 2011, Jobs passed away, leaving an unparalleled impact. Apple's ongoing achievements
				and his design ethos ensure his enduring influence. Steve Jobs' journey symbolizes the transformative power of innovation and the significance of approaching problems uniquely.</p>
